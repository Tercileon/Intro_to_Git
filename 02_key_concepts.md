## Key Concepts

**Commit**

Whenever you save your changes in one or more files, you can create a new commit in Git. A commit is like a snapshot of your entire repository at that point in time, not just of one or two files.

**Commit Message**

Every time you make a commit, you need to supply a message that describes _why_ the change was made. That commit message is invaluable when trying to understand later why a certain change was implemented.

**Stage**

Staging means that you have pending updates that git is aware of, but the changes have not been made permanent in the local repository.

**Branch**

A branch is an independent series of commits off to one side that you can use to try out an experiment or create a new feature.

**Master Branch**

Whenever you create a new Git project, there is a default branch created called **Master**. This is the branch that your work should end up on eventually, once it’s ready to push to production.

**Merge**

A merge is a way to take completed work from one branch and incorporate it into another branch.

**Tag**

A tag is a reference to a specific historic commit. Tags are most often used to document production releases so you know exactly which versions of the code went into production and when.

**Pull Request**

Originally, a pull request was used to request that someone else review the work you’d completed on a branch and then merge it into **Master**. Now, pull requests are often used earlier in the process to start a discussion about a possible feature.

**Clone**

Often you’ll want to download a copy of a project from GitHub so you can work on it locally.

**Fork**

Sometimes you don’t have the necessary permission to make changes directly to a project.  If you want to submit changes to such a project, first you need to make a copy of the project under _your_ user account on GitHub. That process is called _forking_ the repository. You can then clone it, make changes, and submit them back to the original project using a pull request.
